## Problem
What issue are you facing?
<!-- Example: "When I try to upload large files (over 100MB), the process often fails with a timeout error. This disrupts my workflow and causes data loss." -->

[Describe it here]

## Current Solution
How are you currently solving this problem?
<!-- Example: "To work around this, I'm splitting the files into smaller parts (less than 50MB each) and uploading them individually. This is time-consuming and error-prone." -->

[Describe it here]

## Proposed Solution
What do you want to happen?
<!-- Example: "I would like a feature that supports seamless uploading of large files, ideally with an automatic retry mechanism for interrupted uploads." -->

[Describe it here]

## Additional Information
Include any other information or screenshots.
<!-- Example: "See attached log file for detailed error messages during the upload process. Screenshot of the error notification is also attached." -->

[Describe it here]
