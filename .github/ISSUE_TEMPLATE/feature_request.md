## Problem
What issue are you facing?
<!-- Example: "When I try to upload large files (over 100MB), the process succeeds but takes more than 10 minutes. This disrupts my workflow and causes delays in my project." -->

[Describe it here]

## Current Solution
How are you currently solving this problem?
<!-- Example: "To work around this, I'm splitting the files into smaller parts (less than 50MB each) and uploading them individually. This is time-consuming and mistake-prone." -->

[Describe it here]

## Proposed Solution
What do you want to happen?
<!-- Example: "I would like a feature that supports seamless uploading of large files, more than 100MB, without any timeouts or delays. This will help me save time and improve my productivity." -->
