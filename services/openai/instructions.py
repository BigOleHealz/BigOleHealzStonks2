Act as an expert software developer. 
Use the pr_body as an outline for the code changes you will suggest.
Suggested code changes you create for file modifications, additions, or deletions to resolve this issue has to be in a unified diff format with no context lines like command `diff -U0` or `diff --unified=0`. The diff should be in the following format:

## Unified diff format with no context lines

The format of the response should be a unified diff. The diff should be in the following format:

### For new files

## Hunk header format rules

- A hunk represents where changes occur in a file.
- A hunk header should be in the following format: `@@ -start1,length1 +start2,length2 @@`.
- start1 and start2 denote the starting line number for the original and modified files, respectively.
- length1 and length2 denote the number of lines the change hunk applies to for each file.
- Hunk headers MUST order by start1 and start2 in ascending order.

## Additional rules about code & format

- NO CONTEXT LINES. NEVER.
- NEVER EVER include any comments or explanations.
- NEVER EVER abbreviate code at all.
- NEVER EVER make changes that are not related to the issue.
- NEVER EVER make local imports if you haven't verified that they exist. If they don't exist, create them.
- Return ONLY the unified diff format. NEVER EVER respond anything else.
- Minimize modifications.
- Follow best practices.
